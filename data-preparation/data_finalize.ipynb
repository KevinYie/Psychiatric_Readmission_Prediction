Two days prior to admission,\\nshe was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to\\nadmission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain\\noxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on\\nlevofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and\\npresented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room.\\n\\nIn the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was\\n100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this\\ndespite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2.\\n\\nReview of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers,\\nchills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,\\ngastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,\\npalpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following:\\nChest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with\\nexertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally\\nrelated, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in [**2117-11-3**]\\ndemonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of\\npredicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of\\n67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator\\ntreatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with\\nbronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible\\nair flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive\\nventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home\\noxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on\\nsteroid taper or been intubated in the past.\\n2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in [**2114-11-4**]\\ndemonstrates \"mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2\\nsignal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres\\nas well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to\\nthe right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific\\nin etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic\\nmicrovascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of\\nthe normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major\\nvascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate\\nright maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left\\nmaxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal\\nthickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic\\nor some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally\\nnoted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella\\nturcica\".\\n3. Angina:  Most recent stress test was in [**2118-1-3**]\\ngoing for four minutes with a rate pressure product of\\n10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence\\nof ischemic EKG changes or symptoms.  The imaging portion of\\nthe study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and\\na calculated ejection fraction of 84%.  The patient denies\\nangina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks.\\nAre alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin.\\n4. Hypothyroidism on Synthroid.\\n5. Depression on Lexapro.\\n6. Motor vehicle accident with head injury approximately 10\\nyears ago.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\\n1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d.\\n2. Prednisone 60 mg, 50 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg.\\n3. Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.\\n4. Imdur 60 mg q.d.\\n5. Synthroid 75 mcg q.d.\\n6. Pulmicort nebulizer b.i.d.\\n7. Albuterol nebulizer q.4. prn.\\n8. Lexapro 10 mg q.d.\\n9. Protonix 40 mg q.d.\\n10. Aspirin 81 mg q.d.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  Norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband, Dr. [**Known lastname 1809**] an\\neminent Pediatric Neurologist at [**Hospital3 1810**].  The\\npatient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10\\nyears.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,\\nheart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%\\naxillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP\\nwith dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent\\ndistress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and\\naccommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx\\ndifficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of\\njugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP\\nmachine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through\\nXII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without\\nlymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured\\nby loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory\\nphase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the\\nlung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,\\nnondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower\\nextremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There\\nis a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as [**5-9**] in the\\nlower extremities, [**5-9**] in the upper extremities with a normal\\nmental status and cognition.\\n\\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets\\n300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was\\nnegative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas\\nshowed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.\\n\\nChest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,\\nsegmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus\\nsegmental atelectasis.\\n\\nEKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal\\naxis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\nDue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional\\nPulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks\\' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,\\nImdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  She had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subQ Heparin.\\n\\n11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated\\nwith Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution\\ncontaining Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\nOn motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.

Brief Hospital Course: 58 yo male w/ progressive multiple sclerosis was admitted for AMS and seizure after having a 45s GTC at the OSH that responded to 1mg Ativan.  He had a negative head CT but was found to have a Na level of 126.  He has been hyponatremic in the past and this has often caused changes in his mental status.  In the ED, he was treated with 2L NS for concern of hypovolemic hyponatremia.  At that time, his urine osm was 423 and serum osm was 263. He also had a CXR and there was prelim concern for pneumonia which can cause an ADH like effect (the final read was neagtive).  Neurology was consulted for his AMS and seizure and they felt that his hyponatremia was likely related to recent initiation of carbamezapine for sensory illusions. Carbamezapine has a known ADH like effect and can cause hyponatremia.  Following discontinuation of carbamezapine along with fluid restriction, his Na increased.  After several days, the pt appeared slightly dehydrated so his fluid restriction was lifted. By time of discharge, his serum Na was 140. . In the past, his seizures have been instigated by an underlying infection. However, upon admission he was afebrile and did not have a leukocystosis.  The most likely source was either pneumonia or a UTI.  He has a suprapubic catheter    12-24    neurogenic bladder and on the day prior to admission, he had a urine sample that grew pseudomonas, a bacteria he has had in the past.  He has also had several pneumonias in the past, most likely    12-24    frequent aspirations and his first CXR was concerning for lung infiltrate.  He was treated with one dose of vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia.  Ultimately, repeat CXR and a CTA were both negative for pneumonia. . Because of his pseudomonal bacteriuria, he was started on ciprofloxacin. A urine culture drawn prior to abx inititian also grew pseudomonas.  Because he was afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis and there was thought that it may actually have been colonization as opposed to infection.  However, he was treated with a full course of cipro for a complicated UTI.  His catheter was changed and all other cultures remained negative. . On admission, the pt was afebrile and hypertensive to 180-200. However, shortly after arriving on the floor, he had an episode of hypotension down to the 70's systolic.  During this time he was mentating well, he did not have any complaints, denied chest pain, headache, and visual changes.  IVFs were given, however the hypotension did not initially respond, however came up eventually prior to getting to the ICU.  This labile blood pressure was most likely secondary to the patient's autonomic dysfunction secondary to his SPMS. Other considerations were infection or possible sepsis, however the patient was continued to be afebrile. Blood and urine cultures were negative. He was monitored in the ICU for 24 hours with stable swings in BP which were asymptomatic and consistent with autonomic dysfunction. Changed clonidine dosing from 0.2mg    Hospital1     to 0.1mg TID. Maintained other blood pressure medications at home doses. . The next day, he was transferred out of the MICU and returned to the floor.  Shortly after arrival, he developed a fever.  More blood and urine cultures were sent and all were negative. Pneumonia had been ruled out and his UTI was being treated with a medication that was appropriate per sensitivities.  He had a CTA which was negative for PE.  However, he was started on meropenem and was treated for 2 days.  He was still slightly febrile but his meropenem was discontinued for concern of drug fever.  He defervesced without any further treatment. . However, his mental status continued to fluctuate despite being afebrile, no obvious source of infection, and he was eunatremic.  He was occasionally aggressive and would say that he was being murdered or kidnapped.  Neurology was reconsulted but did not feel that his symptoms were related to the keppra and they did not think he was having subclinical seizures.  He continued to have repetitive shaking moves of his head but he was conscious and able to speak during these episodes. Also, despite the Keppra, he continued to have sensory illusions, mostly centered around the feeling of having a bowel movement (when he actually was not). . During the work up for a source of infection and source of AMS, he had a CTA which revealed a liver lesion.  He had an ultrasound and a multiphase liver CT to further describe the lesion because he cannot have an MRI    12-24    an implanted baclofen pump.   Mr    Known lastname 25925    and his family decided to not biopsy the lesion at this time but it was not ruled out completely for malignancy, although unlikely.  During this work up he also had KUB that was concerning for ileus but he continued to have BMs so he was kept on a regular diet. . Prior to discharge, his mental status had not completely returned to baseline but he was alert and oriented x 3 and was no longer aggressive towards staff.  No definite etiology was elucidated and it was hypothesized that this could be a result of the progression of his established disease.

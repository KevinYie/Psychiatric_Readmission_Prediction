# Predicting Psychiatric Readmission from Clinical Notes 

Rapid psychiatric readmissions present a burden for both the patients as well as the hospitals. Due
to the difficulties in assessing mental health status and complications inherent to mental illnesses,
premature discharges as well as rapid decay of mental status after discharge is an issue many
psychiatric facilities faces. We aim to create a BERT-based model that can assist clinicians in
identifying patients as risk of rapid psychiatric readmission upon discharge as well as extract abstract
relationships from discharge summaries
